  # according to various places on the intertubes, a simple and relatively efficient way to
  # find primes is the sieve of eratosthenes.  i'm certainly not enough of a math head to
  # come up with something like this on my own, so googling was important.  basically the
  # way the algorithm works is by looking at an array and iteratively skip counting through
  # it.  you stop iterating when you reach a value that is greater than the sqrt of the
  # largest number in the array (as the higher values have all already been marked or
  # are prime.)  once you stop iterating, any values that remain non-null are prime.
  # time complexity here is  O(n(log(log(n))), which is not terrible.
