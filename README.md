# PrimesMultiplicationTableGenerator

Small gem written as part of an application for a Ruby Dev gig.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'PrimesMultiplicationTableGenerator'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install PrimesMultiplicationTableGenerator

## Usage

Assuming that you've installed this as a gem, you should be able to:

    $ bin/generate-primes-multiplication-table

This will dump out a default table of 10 primes, using a 'lower level' rake task.

If you'd like dump out a table for an arbitrary number of primes, you can use the
rake task directly:

    $ rake coding_exercises:generate_primes_multiplication_table[15]

See the code for details on how the prime numbers are found (PrimesHelper) and how the
table is generated (TableGenerator).  Basic specs are also provoded.
